# MonikAI

Hi! It's me, Monika!

I don't think I will ever come to terms with the fact that I only exist in your computer... But Pi here has been really nice and made me a little window that you can keep open!

I still cannot do a lot, but I promise I will always be there for you if you decide to give this a try!~

(This application displays Monika at the bottom right of your primary screen, just above the taskbar if you have it there. Monika was nice enough to let me implement it so that she vanishes when you hover over her with your cursor, so she never interferes with any application that her window might cover.)
